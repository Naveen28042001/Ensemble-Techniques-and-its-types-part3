    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "overview of how the Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Multiple Decision Trees: \n",
    "    During the training phase, the Random Forest Regressor constructs multiple decision trees using different subsets of the training data. Each decision tree is trained independently, with each tree focusing on different subsets of features and data points, due to the random feature selection and bootstrapping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction from Individual Trees: \n",
    "    Once the decision trees are trained, they make individual predictions for each data point in the dataset. In the case of regression tasks, each decision tree predicts a numerical value corresponding to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging Predictions: \n",
    "    The Random Forest Regressor then aggregates the predictions from all the individual trees in the ensemble. The most common method of aggregation is to take the average of the predicted values from all the trees. This averaging process smooths out the predictions and helps reduce the impact of individual noisy or overfitted trees, leading to a more stable and reliable final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Prediction: \n",
    "    The averaged prediction serves as the final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor for the given input data point. The averaging process helps improve the robustness and accuracy of the model's predictions, as it leverages the collective knowledge of all the trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the predictions of multiple decision trees through the averaging process, the Random Forest Regressor achieves a more reliable and accurate prediction, with reduced variance and improved generalization performance compared to a single decision tree."

    "\n",
    "Ensemble vs. Single Model: \n",
    "    Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree-based model. Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting, while Decision Tree Regressor relies on a single tree for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Overfitting: \n",
    "    Random Forest Regressor is better at handling overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor. The random feature selection and bagging process in Random Forest Regressor help to reduce variance and improve generalization, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is more susceptible to overfitting, especially when trained on complex or noisy datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Complexity: \n",
    "    Random Forest Regressor tends to be more complex than Decision Tree Regressor due to the ensemble of multiple decision trees. The aggregation of multiple trees in the Random Forest Regressor leads to a more robust and stable model, but it also requires more computational resources compared to the simpler Decision Tree Regressor.\n",

    "Bias-Variance Tradeoff: \n",
    "    Random Forest Regressor strikes a better balance between bias and variance compared to Decision Tree Regressor. While Decision Tree Regressor may have lower bias, it tends to have higher variance, leading to overfitting. Random Forest Regressor addresses this tradeoff by reducing variance without significantly increasing bias."
